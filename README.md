##### Abstract: Most fast k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithms exploit metric properties of distance measures for reducing computation cost and a few can work effectively on both metric and nonmetric measures. We propose a cluster-based tree algorithm to accelerate k-NN classification without any presuppositions about the metric form and properties of a dissimilarity measure. A mechanism of early decision making and minimal side-operations for choosing searching paths largely contribute to the efficiency of the algorithm. The algorithm is evaluated through extensive experiments over standard NIST and MNIST databases.
